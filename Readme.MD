## Roman Numeral Converter

### Purpose of this repository

This repository is intended as a starting point for implementing the roman numerals code kata. To get you started
take a look at this site: [http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html](http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html)

Roman Numerals are defined as follows:
- 1 => I  
- 5 => V  
- 10 => X  
- 50 => L  
- 100 => C  
- 500 => D  
- 1000 => M  

There are a few exceptions to keep in mind. Especially that 4 is represented as IV, and 9 is represented as IX. Make sure
to reflect these in your implementation. A test suite has been provided to you. Start by running the tests and looking at
the first error you receive. That is assuming you've installed the composer dependencies by running `composer install`.
